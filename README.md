# field-simulation

This is a take on the traditional hockey game inspired by
[electric-hockey](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/electric-hockey) where
the hockey puck is a charged particle, and players control
the game by placing positive and negative charges on the
field to attract or repel the puck. The goal is to maneuver
the puck into the opponent's goal while defending your own.

In addition to the game, an reinforcement learning (RL) is
trained for playing the game.
